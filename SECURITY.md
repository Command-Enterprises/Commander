## Before Reporting
# Things to know before reporting
Before reporting, you should know a few things.

1. It's a website. There isnt a big security focus as there are no places to log in and no sensitive data to steal.
2. Many of the vulnerabilties will come from the games that are hosted on our platform. We can't do anything about that but you can still report the sites in our discussions page or email us to find a new website that hosts the game.
